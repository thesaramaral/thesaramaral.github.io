## Sara Maral Helalian

I am a first-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, where I study neurobiology and mathematics. I am interested in designing neural pathways to predict behavior, and in math, I am working on proving o-minimal structures in model theory.

### Research

As of February 2022, I am studying algebraic topology and o-minimal structures from set-theoretic and model-theoretic perspectives to prove these structures and learn about their applications to number theory.
